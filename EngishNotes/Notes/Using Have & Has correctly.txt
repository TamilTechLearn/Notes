0:00 How’s your present? Is it perfect? really? I don't think anyone's present is perfect.
0:08 but if you wanna make your present perfect that join me in this lesson about present
0:14 perfect in English conversation. that's what you are learning with me today, my name is
0:20 Michelle. let's go.
0:37 So I'll do a quick reminder for you. when do we use the present perfect tense? so we
0:43 use the present perfect tense to talk about an event that started in the past but is still
0:51 now relevant, that's when he use present perfect and what about the form of present perfect?
0:58 so I'll write two sentences for you here. I’ve been to Sydney. but if you want to
1:14 talk about someone else, for example, she, then you'd say she's been to Sydney. Okay
1:23 first things first, I've stands for I + have. so this is a contraction for I + have which
1:34 means, I've, which is pronounced as I've. and she's is a contraction for she + has and
1:45 it's pronounced as she's. please don't confuse it with she is. it's she has. be careful about
1:52 that. so you use had/have or has. had is used when you need to talk about something in the
2:06 past plus third form. alright so let's start with some very interesting phrases here.

2:22 I've known her for ages. so for this I think, I'm gonna give you a situation. I have this
2:29 friend, this joinee at work and once we were having a conversation and you know we were
2:37 sharing about each other's lives, about our lives and I told her, my best friend is Rebecca.
2:42 she said, I also have a friend named Rebecca. I said, okay and I told her my best friend
2:46 is an artist and she said coincidentally my friend is also an artist and I was like, I
2:53 hope you are not talking about Rebecca Jones and she was like, yeah. I am talking about
2:57 Rebecca Jones. I was like are you talking about Rebecca Jones from Toronto? she said,
3:01 yeah, the same girl and I said, small world and this girl asked me, so how do you know
3:08 her? and I replied, I've known her for ages. she is my best friend since grade 4. so basically,
3:16 known her for ages means a very long time. ages, a very long time. so you can use this,
3:32 I've known her for ages to talk about someone that you have known for a very long time.
3:40 may be many years or some months in certain cases.

3:45 let's look at the next one, I've had a tough day. so tough means difficult. so if you're
3:53 day is coming to an end, I mean you can see the day closing, then you can say, I had a
3:59 tough day, which is past simple. however, if you're meeting your friends for lunch and
4:06 you want to tell about how your day was so far and you think it was tough. so you could  
4:12 say, I've had a tough day, which means from the past when the day started until now. so
4:20 this talks about the connection between the past and the present. well if you haven't
4:26 had a tough day and you had a great day so far, you could say, I've had a great day,
4:31 I've had a fun day. so anything, you can replace it, you can use any of the variations, from
4:40 when the day started until now.

4:49 alright, so the third one, this is the first time I've been here. remember whenever you
5:03 use this phrase, this is the first time, it's always followed by present perfect and you
5:11 can use it for something that you've not done before or a place where you've never been
5:16 before or something that you've never seen before or anything that you've not heard before.
5:22 so may be your friend is making you listen to a new song and you're hearing it for the
5:28 first time and he's like have you heard it before? you'd say, this is the first time
5:34 I heard it or this is the first time I've heard it. I have, have is very important.
5:40 and the same way if you're visiting a place for the first time, you could say, this is
5:44 the first time I've been here or this is the first time I've seen this movie, any of the
5:49 variations.


5:50 let's look at the next one, I haven't done it yet. so this is also used to talk about
5:58 an event in the past. so let's say, you're mother asked you to take the garbage out of
6:06 your room or to take the rubbish out of the dustbin and you haven't done it and your mom
6:11 says, have you taken the rubbish out? and you haven't done it, so you could say, I haven't
6:18 done it yet, mom I'll do it right away. that's when you can do it, you can use it and probably
6:25 may be your mom will forgive you, just may be. so a recent event in the past. Yet means
6:42 that you're still to do the event, the activity.

6:45 okay, let's look at the next one, I've had a great evening, okay so this is a really
6:52 good phrase to use when you're on a date and with your significant other or someone that
6:58 you are may be meeting for the first time on a blind date and if you had a really nice
7:02 time and you want them to feel good, you could say, I've had a great evening. but you can
7:10 call your best friend later and you could tell her, Simona I've had the worst date of
7:17 my life today. of course you can use the same phrase to express different feelings. so you
7:22 could say, I've had the worst date of my life. so instead of evening, you could also say,
7:46 I’ve had a great time or I've had a wonderful time, I've had a lovely time. any of these
7:52 variations or I've had a terrible time.

7:55 let's look at the next one, I've had enough. how does this look like? is this very satisfying?
8:02 No, this is like, this is the last point, the peak point, there is something that you
8:08 cannot accept anymore. so if you're girlfriend or boyfriend is still talking to their ex
8:14 and you don't like it, you could tell, Kate I've had enough, if you continue to talk to
8:20 Jack, we are through with it. interesting phrase and very useful phrase. when you are
8:27 done with something and you can't accept it anymore.

8:45 have you heard that iPhone has launched its new x6 plus with 3D touch? no you haven't
8:53 heard? Okay so what am I doing here, I'm trying to tell you about news or something that I've
8:59 heard recently and I think maybe you've not heard. so whenever I wanna tell you a news
9:06 may be from the television or anything that happened or in another case, maybe I wanna
9:11 tell you something that happened in my friend's life, I could say, have you heard.. whatever?
9:17 have you heard Anna and Paul had a baby? so that's when you can use it, to share about
9:25 news.

9:37 with this, we complete this lesson to talk about the present perfect tense. please use
9:43 this tense in your everyday conversation to sound more natural coz this is a very commonly
9:49 used tense and it can help you talk not only about the past but even the present and this
9:56 is how you make your present, very, very perfect.
